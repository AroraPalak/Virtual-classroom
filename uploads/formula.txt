H.C.F and L.C.M :
H.C.F stands for Highest Common Factor. The other names for H.C.F are Greatest Common Divisor (G.C.D) and Greatest Common Measure (G.C.M).
The H.C.F. of two or more numbers is the greatest number that divides each one of them exactly.
The least number which is exactly divisible by each one of the given numbers is called their L.C.M.
Two numbers are said to be co-prime if their H.C.F. is 1.
H.C.F. of fractions = H.C.F. of numerators/L.C.M of denominators
L.C.M. of fractions = G.C.D. of numerators/H.C.F of denominators

Product of two numbers = Product of their H.C.F. and L.C.M.

PERCENTAGES :
1.If A is R% more than B, then B is less than A by R / (100+R) * 100
2.If A is R% less than B, then B is more than A by R / (100-R) * 100
3.If the price of a commodity increases by R%, then reduction in consumption, not to increase the expenditure is : R/(100+R)*100
4.If the price of a commodity decreases by R%, then the increase in consumption, not to decrease the expenditure is : R/(100-R)*100

PROFIT & LOSS :
1.Gain = Selling Price(S.P.) - Cost Price(C.P)
2.Loss = C.P. - S.P.
3.Gain % = Gain * 100 / C.P.
4.Loss % = Loss * 100 / C.P.
5.S.P. = (100+Gain%)/100*C.P.
6.S.P. = (100-Loss%)/100*C.P.

RATIO & PROPORTIONS:
1.The ratio a : b represents a fraction a/b. a is called antecedent and b is called consequent.
2.The equality of two different ratios is called proportion.
3.If a : b = c : d then a, b, c, d are in proportion. This is represented by a : b :: c : d.
4.In a : b = c : d, then we have a* d = b * c.
5.If a/b = c/d then ( a + b ) / ( a – b ) = ( d + c ) / ( d – c ).

TIME & WORK :
1.If A can do a piece of work in n days, then A's 1 day's work = 1/n

3.If A is twice as good workman as B, then ratio of work done by A and B = 2:1

3.If a pipe can fill a tank in x hours, and another pipe can empty the full tank in y hours, then on opening both the pipes, 

the net part filled in 1 hour = (1/x-1/y) if y>x
the net part emptied in 1 hour = (1/y-1/x) if x>y

TIME & DISTANCE :
1.Distance = Speed * Time
2.1 km/hr = 5/18 m/sec
3.1 m/sec = 18/5 km/hr
4.Suppose a man covers a certain distance at x kmph and an equal distance at y kmph. Then, the average speed during the whole journey is 2xy/(x+y) kmph.

PROBLEMS ON TRAINS :
1.Time taken by a train x metres long in passing a signal post or a pole or a standing man is equal to the time taken by the train to cover x metres.
2.Time taken by a train x metres long in passing a stationary object of length y metres is equal to the time taken by the train to cover x+y metres.
3.Suppose two trains are moving in the same direction at u kmph and v kmph such that u>v, then their relative speed = u-v kmph.
4.If two trains of length x km and y km are moving in the same direction at u kmph and v kmph, where u>v, then time taken by the faster train to cross the slower train = (x+y)/(u-v) hours.
5.Suppose two trains are moving in opposite directions at u kmph and v kmph. Then, their relative speed = (u+v) kmph.
6.If two trains of length x km and y km are moving in the opposite directions at u kmph and v kmph, then time taken by the trains to cross each other = (x+y)/(u+v)hours.
7.If two trains start at the same time from two points A and B towards each other and after crossing they take a and b hours in reaching B and A respectively, then A's speed : B's speed = (vb : v
